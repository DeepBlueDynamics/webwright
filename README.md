# Webwright: Web Automation Done Right ðŸš€

This project provides command line tools to quickly set up new websites with included templates, automate commits to GitHub, and leverage Google Cloud Run for hosting.

## Overview

1. **Local Setup**: 
   - Users download the code to their local machine.
   - The code provides command line tools to quickly set up a new website.
   - There are a few website templates included in the `examples` directory.

2. **GitHub Integration**: 
   - Once the code is committed to GitHub and integrated with Cloud Run, the AI can take over.

3. **Admin Interface**: 
   - The website itself has an admin interface for updating the code.
   - Users can simply talk to the site and tell it what to update about itself.
   - This allows updates to be done by the owners without involving the support or website creation team.

4. **Command Line Tools**: 
   - These tools allow website creation agencies to create new sites quickly and deploy them for review.

5. **GitHub Storage**: 
   - The sites are committed to GitHub and are likely stored on the website agency's GitHub account.

6. **Google Cloud Run Hosting**: 
   - Google Cloud Run is used on an agency's Google Cloud account to host the site.
