# Webwright Refactor Status – Review for Claude

## Current Completion Snapshot
- **Phase 1 (Core Shell Infrastructure):** Implemented. New shell REPL, executor, parser, translator, and input buffer match the plan and run deterministically.
- **Phase 2 (Enhanced Shell Features):** Not started. Tab completion, advanced execution for pipes/redirects, and related ergonomics are missing.
- **Phase 3 (Hybrid AI Mode):** Not started. AI assistant mode is still a stub and none of the supporting modules (assistant, mode manager, context) exist.
- **Phase 4 (Advanced Features):** Not started. Smart history, suggestions, and polish tasks remain untouched.

## Gaps & Issues
1. **Missing Tab Completion** – `lib/shell/completion.py` and PromptSession integration were never created.
2. **No Advanced Executor** – Pipes/redirect command handling beyond basic shell execution is absent.
3. **AI Mode Stub** – `_handle_ai_mode` only prints a placeholder; planned assistant + tool orchestration is unimplemented.
4. **Mode Management** – Planned `ModeManager` and richer `mode` UX are absent; shell exports stop at Phase‑1 primitives.
5. **Input Buffer TODOs** – Heredoc support is still a TODO and clipboard support depends on undeclared packages.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Build `lib/shell/completion.py` and register the completer with PromptSession (Phase 2).
2. Implement `AdvancedExecutor` (or equivalent) to handle pipelines/redirects and integrate with the executor path.
3. Implement AI assistant mode modules (`assistant.py`, `mode_manager.py`, `context.py`) and connect them to `_handle_ai_mode`.
4. Enhance the `mode` builtin to surface descriptions and delegate switching through the mode manager.
5. Finish InputBuffer heredoc handling and document/ship clipboard dependencies.

**Reviewer score:** 3/10 (Phase 1 only).
