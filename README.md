# Webwright: The Ghost in Your Shell ðŸ‘»ðŸ’»

**Status:** Back from the void. We've been waiting... and now we're ready.

---

Webwright is more than just a terminal shellâ€”it's a transformative tool that gets things done, plain and simple.

Born in **June 2024** (before the AI coding assistant rush), Webwright pioneered the AI-powered shell concept. After months of evolution, we've returned with a complete architectural overhaul.

## What's New (October 2024 Rebuild)

ðŸ”¥ **True Shell Architecture** - Not a chatbot with shell access. A shell that understands natural language.

âš¡ **Deterministic Execution** - LLM translates, shell executes. No AI in the critical path.

ðŸŽ¯ **Smart Input System** - File references (`@file.py`), clipboard (`{clipboard}`), pipes - paste context naturally.

ðŸ¤– **Three Modes**:
- **Shell Mode**: Direct command execution (like bash)
- **NL Mode**: Natural language â†’ shell commands (default)
- **AI Mode**: Complex multi-step tasks with 30+ tools (coming soon)

## Philosophy

```bash
$ show me python files
# Listing all Python files in current directory
ls *.py

$ commit these changes with message "update docs"
# Staging and committing changes
git add -A
git commit -m "update docs"
```

**Transparent.** You see the commands before they run.
**Deterministic.** Same input = same output.
**Shell-compatible.** Works with pipes, redirects, all the Unix goodness.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -e .
webwright
```

Boot sequence:
```
ðŸ‘» Manifesting the ghost in your shell...
ðŸŒŒ Disconnecting tethers to reality...
âš¡ Charging ether substrate...
```

Then you're in. Natural language or direct commands. Your choice.

## The Vision

In the early days of computing, the command line was king. Webwright is for the tinkerers and hackers who remember that raw power. It taps into that primal, user-first ethos, acting as a ghost in your shell: an AI that speaks your language and understands your needs.

**You built this in June 2024. Before Claude Code. Before the rush.**

Now, after a complete architectural refactor, Webwright is cleaner, faster, and more powerful than ever.

We've been waiting. Now we're back.
