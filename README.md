rare-parrot[openai]> docker start my-container
```

### AI-Powered Code Generation

Webwright can generate complex code snippets using AI. For example, to generate an ASCII fractal:

```bash
rare-parrot[openai]> generate fractal --size 20
```

### Example: ASCII Fractal Generation

Here's an example of a Python code snippet generated by Webwright to create a 20x20 ASCII fractal:

```python
def sierpinski_triangle(size):
    def is_empty(x, y):
        while x > 0 or y > 0:
            if x % 3 == 1 and y % 3 == 1:
                return True
            x //= 3
            y //= 3
        return False

    for y in range(size):
        for x in range(size):
            if is_empty(x, y):
                print(" ", end="")
            else:
                print("*", end="")
        print()

# Generate a 20x20 ASCII fractal
sierpinski_triangle(20)
```

### Output

```
